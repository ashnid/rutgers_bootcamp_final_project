# rutgers_bootcamp_final_project

## Introduction:
In this project we analyzed the market data from Kaggle website “https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs”. The Kaggle website provides market data for each stock indices for the last few years. We downloaded the file for some of the top stocks for analysis purposes.

Machine Learning Linear Regression model/multiple Linear Regression model is used for the analysis, the is split into training, testing and scaling/predictions.

The main purpose of the project is to get the indices prediction for the next quarter based on different algorithms, logics, patterns, that will be discussed in detail as we start developing the project.

In the dashboard we planned to include some of the major stock indices, we included a drop down to choose the stock symbols and get the predictions for next quarter. The patterns also could be chosen by the users to get the predictions. The list of patterns used will be discussed in detail as we start implementing the project.
